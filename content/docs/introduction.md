# Introduction

## Overview

Between high-level programming languages (Java, Haskell, Rust, Prolog...) and low-level machine models (x86, ARM, RISC-V, FPGAs, Turing machines,...) there is an intermediate category of *abstract machines*.
These abstract machines are much simpler than programming languages, which are mainly intended for human users, yet abstract enough to not be concerned with details of concrete instruction set or computer architectures.
These abstract machines are what we are going to study in this seminar.
